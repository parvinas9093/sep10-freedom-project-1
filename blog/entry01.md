# Entry 1: Why Health of the Infants? 
##### 10/14/24

A topic that I had chosen to work on in this project is health, to be more specific the health of the newborns. After alot of thinking and reasearches I decided on this topic because of my experiences with the babies and my love towards them. During my reasearch I came across some painful articles and images that touched my heart. I was emphasized after witnessing their pain they had been in at such a young age. At first I was planning on making this project about cooking/baking or the movement of youth to begin with as it was something I was pattionate about and was interested in since the beggining of my teen years. Although I had stopped on something else I really liked the articles I had read about them. As cooking/baking is one of the ways to share your love with people with no words or actions! Some of knowledgable articles like, [How Cooking Together Meets All Love Language] (https://dinnerwithtayo.com/how-cooking-together-meets-all-love-language/#:~:text=When%20we%20cook%20with%20someone,you%E2%80%9D%20without%20saying%20the%20words.) caught my attention.
